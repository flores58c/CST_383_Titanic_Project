We have taken up this project in order to, study the various demographics of the people onboard the Titanic, determine how various factors influenced their survival. These factors include age, gender, and class. Since these factors typically have strong effects on how an individual is viewed in society, this project can show how these factors may or may not still have held influence in a chaotic situation such as this.
